      <p>Working Culture @ Code-X Technologies</p>
      <p>Working environment has evolved over the years that each person feels comfortable to develop their skills or potential and make the best use of their abilities. This is made possible by brining in bright minds with diverse backgrounds having unique technical strengths. Exchange of technical views have not only helped faster solutions but had also brought out new ideas helping all i.e clients, team members and the organization. Freedom is to bring in joy and achieve results with happiness. The only constraints are maintaining project schedules with quality delivery and within client budgets. Again we achieve this because of brain storming sessions at the start of each project, preparing development mile stones i.e creating the road map to completion . Here everybody realizes that Company growth, meeting client schedules and strategies are not different than their own career growth. This scientific approach has helped all in the company who work as partners to contribute their lot and also learn to develop their potential happily.</p></div>
